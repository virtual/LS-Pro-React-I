# Homework #1

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* let - defines a variable that may change, only accessed within block code
	* const - defines a variable that will not change, only accessed within block code
	* ES6 Classes - similar to that of a function, contains the content or HTML that will be referred to when the class is referenced
	* import/export - import necessary files into a class/js file. export files out similar to a return
	* JSX - a form of HTML that is used in Babel, there are minor differences between it and XHTML
	* this.props - a way to access properties that are passed in when referencing a React class


2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.
		
	* Run: `npm install -g create-react-app`
	* Create a boilerplate React app called Profile. `create-react-app profile`
	* Navigate into /profile and run the command: `npm start`
	* Your `<App />` component will render a `<NavBar />` and a `<Body />` component.
	* Create a file called `NavBar.js` and a file called `Body.js`
	* `<NavBar />` and `<Body />` will both be React components.  `<NavBar />` should display the title of your page in a larger font.
	* `<Body />` will display some information about yourself.
	* Try adding an image, some text, and some links to your github profile.
	* For the content in `<Body />` try to break things down into their own components as much as you can.  The purpose of this exercise is to practice creating basic components.  You should be very comfortable with the basic syntax of creating React components before the next lesson.
